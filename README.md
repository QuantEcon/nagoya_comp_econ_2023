## Content

Computational methods and scientific computing are becoming increasingly
central to research, analysis and policy work in economics, finance and social
science.

This is an introductory workshop for students and policy makers who are
interested in learning about the evolution of modern scientific computing
tools and how they can be applied to economic problems. The main language used
in the workshop will be Python, although other languages will also be
discussed.

Topics will include simulation, vectorization, JIT compilers, and
parallelization.
